# 🧠 Resume Chatbot using AI (RAG + Streamlit)

Yo! 👋  
This is a project I built that lets you **upload your resume** and literally **chat with it** like it's your HR manager.

You can ask things like:
> “What are my strengths?”  
> “Am I good for a data science role?”  
> “Summarize my resume for an interview”  

And the bot will answer. ✨

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- Streamlit (for UI)  
- LangChain (RAG pipeline)  
- FAISS (for memory storage)  
- HuggingFace embeddings (free + powerful)  
- Together AI (for LLM responses)  
- OCR (for reading images like resume.jpg)

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP  
2. Open folder in **VS Code**

4. Install everything and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
📁 File Support
You can upload any of these:

.txt (text resume)

.pdf (PDF resume)

.docx (Word doc)

.jpg, .png (image resume using OCR)

🔐 Note on API Keys
Your .env file is not uploaded to GitHub (thanks to .gitignore)

So your keys are safe

Anyone else using this will just need to:

Get their own Together AI key

Add it in .env the same way

💡 Why I Made This
I was tired of boring static resume analyzers.
I wanted something where I can ask my own resume questions, like a proper chatbot — so I made this with LangChain and other free tools.
